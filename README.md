# AzureFunctionCosmosDB

**GOAL** :

This is an example you can follow to create a CosmosBD-actioned function. Whenever a new record is entered in the DB (or updated! Pay attention to recursion) the function is triggered.
You need to first create the function on Azure, then just edit your code in VS Code e push it to the cloud selecting the Azure resource you've created as a target.
